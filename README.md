# Supervised-models-for-EMG-Signals-classification
Code for the classification of Electromyography (EMG) signals using various supervised learning algorithms. The project is part of a thesis that aims to compare the performance of different models on a dataset obtained from Kaggle and test on a physical circuit of adquisition.
